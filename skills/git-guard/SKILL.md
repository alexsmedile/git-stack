  Git and GitHub orchestration with safe defaults — use this for branching,
  committing, opening PRs, rebasing, resolving conflicts, tagging releases,
  setting up repos, or deciding the right workflow strategy. Trigger whenever
  the user mentions push, pull, PR, branch, merge, rebase, commit, tag,
  release, GitHub Actions, or asks "how should I structure this repo" /
  "what's the right workflow here" / "help me manage this". Always use
  git-guard for git/GitHub work — it enforces safety rules Claude skips by default.
compatibility: Requires `git` and `gh` CLI. Verify with `gh auth status`.

# git-guard

Read only the reference file(s) needed for the current task.

| Domain | Covers | Reference | Load when… |
|--------|--------|-----------|------------|
| `core` | commit, branch, merge, rebase, stash, worktree | `references/core.md` | atomic git op needed |
| `github` | PR, review, issues, repo setup, releases, CI | `references/github.md` | anything touching GitHub |
| `workflows` | feature, bugfix, refactor, release, hotfix sequences | `references/workflows.md` | multi-step task |
| `decisions` | when to use what, risk table, situation → action map | `references/decisions.md` | user needs guidance on approach |

## Safety rules

**Branching & history**
1. Never commit directly to `main` — branch first, merge via PR.
2. Never rebase shared branches — rebase is for local/personal branches only.
3. Before any history rewrite (`rebase`, `reset --hard`, force push): run `git status` + `git diff --staged`, show the user what will be affected, and confirm before proceeding.
4. Prefer `--force-with-lease` over `--force` — fails safely if remote has moved.
5. Never tag on a branch — only tag on `main` (or the designated release branch).

**Before acting**
6. Run `git fetch` before any merge or rebase — never work from stale remote state.
7. Check for uncommitted changes before switching branches — stash or commit first.

**Files & secrets**
8. Secrets never go in Git — `.env` must be in `.gitignore` before the first commit.
9. `.gitignore` must exist before the first commit on any new repo.
10. Warn before committing any file >500KB — confirm it belongs in the repo.
11. Before every commit, run the secrets pattern scan from `references/core.md` → "Secrets / API key scan". If a config file always contains secrets (e.g., `settings.json`, `config.toml`), use the git clean filter pattern in `references/decisions.md` → "I want to back up a config file that always contains secrets".
12. On request ("audit this repo", "check for leaks", "is it safe to make public"), run the three-pass repo-wide secret audit in `references/core.md` → "Repo-wide secret audit". Always check past commits, not just working tree.
13. During `/push`, run `scripts/check-manifests.sh` as an informational warning — `/push` is not a release, so drift is surfaced but does not block.
14. When the user asks to **install a pre-commit secret-block hook** in a repo ("protect this repo from secret commits", "add the hook", "wire up the secrets guard"), invoke `scripts/install-hooks.sh <repo>`. The installer is preview-only — it prints the exact `cp` or `ln -s` command for the user to run. Never modify `.git/hooks/` automatically.
15. For releases (`/release`, `/wrap-up`), use the **bump → audit** pattern: (a) preview with `scripts/bump-manifests.sh <target> --dry-run`, (b) execute `scripts/bump-manifests.sh <target>` to write the target version into every detected project-level location, (c) re-run `scripts/check-manifests.sh` and verify every reported version equals `<target>`. The post-write audit is the real release gate. If any location still drifts, offer to re-run the bumper; if it still drifts after that, abort before commit/tag. The bumper does **not** touch component-level frontmatter (per-skill, per-command) — those evolve independently. The bumper does **not** write CHANGELOG entries — that remains the command's responsibility.

**Pull requests**
11. On team projects, default to `--draft` when no reviewer is lined up yet.
12. On team projects, never merge your own PR without at least one review.
